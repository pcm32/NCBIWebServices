A set of Java clients to access NCBI web services

This project features Java code to access web services provided by the NCBI, mostly through REST services. It only covers the parts that I have needed so far. Portions of the code were developed as part of the MDK-Biowarehouse package, which was jointly developed with John May during my time at the EBI.

The project has dependencies on core packages of MDK.
